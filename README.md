## 🚀 About Me 

I'm a results-driven data scientist passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that advance healthcare innovation. With a B.S. in Analytics from Purdue Global and an M.S. in Data Analytics focused on AWS Cloud Technologies, I'm now preparing for Ph.D. studies in Data Science to deepen my research impact. My recent project on breast cancer survival applied end-to-end predictive modeling and LIME interpretability across genomic and clinical data from 2,000 patients delivering reproducible, privacy-conscious insights for clinical stakeholders. Looking ahead, I’m expanding intoYou specialize in transforming complex healthcare data especially genomic and clinical datasets—into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making and improve patient outcomes. combining statistical rigor with stakeholder-focused storytelling to drive meaningful outcomes.

My focus is specialize in transforming complex healthcare data especially genomic and clinical datasets into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

When I'm not immersed in data science and predictive modeling, I find joy in music. I play the piano and spend time in my personal recording studio, where I write and produce original compositions. Music fuels my creativity and sharpens my storytelling—whether through sound or data, I’m always exploring new ways to connect, express, and inspire.

## 🧪 Ongoing Clinical Data Science Projects

I'm currently advancing predictive modeling and interpretability across several high-impact healthcare domains:

- **FSGS Kidney Disease** – Modeling disease progression and treatment response using clinical and genomic data.
- **Bipolar Disorder** – Analyzing mood episode patterns and classification models to support psychiatric decision-making.
- **Schizophrenia** – Exploring symptom clusters and model transparency to enhance understanding of disease trajectories.
- **Prostate Cancer** – Investigating survival outcomes and biomarker significance through end-to-end analytics pipelines.
- **Colon Cancer** – Applying feature importance and visual storytelling to uncover key drivers of patient outcomes.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
